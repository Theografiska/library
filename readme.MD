# Library App

This is a Library App created as part of an Odin Project assignment. It allows users to add, display, update, and remove books from their personal library.

## Features

- **Add Books**:  
  Use the "New Book" button to open a form and input book details, including title, author, pages, and read status.

- **Display Library**:  
  All books are displayed as cards, dynamically generated from an array.

- **Remove Books**:  
  Each book card includes a button to remove it from the library.

- **Toggle Read Status**:  
  Easily update a book's read status using a button on its card.

## Assignment Goals

- **Book Management**:  
  Store book objects in an array and dynamically add them using a constructor function.
  
- **Separation of Concerns**:  
  Separate book data storage from the logic used to display books.

- **Dynamic Form Handling**:  
  Implement a form to add new books without reloading the page, using `event.preventDefault()`.

- **Interactive UI**:  
  Allow users to interact with the library through buttons to remove or toggle book statuses.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and layout.
- **CSS3**: Styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: DOM manipulation and functionality.

## Future Enhancements
